Operating as Westalis\' master spy, Twilight works tirelessly to prevent extremists from sparking a war with neighboring country Ostania. For his latest mission, he must investigate Ostanian politician Donovan Desmond by infiltrating his son\'s school: the prestigious Eden Academy. Thus, the agent faces the most difficult task of his career: get married, have a child, and play family.\n\nTwilight, or \"Loid Forger,\" quickly adopts the unassuming orphan Anya to play the role of a six-year-old daughter and prospective Eden Academy student. For a wife, he comes across Yor Briar, an absent-minded office worker who needs a pretend partner of her own to impress her friends. However, Loid is not the only one with a hidden nature. Yor moonlights as the lethal assassin \"Thorn Princess.\" For her, marrying Loid creates the perfect cover. Meanwhile, Anya is not the ordinary girl she appears to be; she is an esper, the product of secret experiments that allow her to read minds. Although she uncovers their true identities, Anya is thrilled that her new parents are cool secret agents! She would never tell them, of course. That would ruin the fun.\n\nUnder the guise of \"The Forgers,\" the spy, the assassin, and the esper must act as a family while carrying out their own agendas. Although these liars and misfits are only playing parts, they soon find that family is about far more than blood relations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]',	NULL,	'25/03/2019',	NULL,	NULL,	'currently_publishing',	'https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/3/219741l.jpg',	NULL),

Major Motoko Kusanagi, a woman of impenetrable caliber and bravado, leads Section 9 on its mission to tackle cyberterrorism and ensure that the nation\'s stability does not falter in the pace of the rapidly progressing future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]',	NULL,	'01/03/1989',	1,	NULL,	'finished',	'https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/155733l.jpg',	NULL),

Neither popular, smart, nor athletic, he excels in only one thing: video games. Haruo would rather spend hours at the local arcade honing his gaming skills than take his life and academics seriously.\n\nOne day, Haruo meets his match in fellow classmate Akira Oono. Akira is not the type of person to frequent an arcade: she has perfect grades, is well-loved, and comes from a wealthy background. Even so, not only is she able to score a 29-game win streak, but she also manages to beat Haruo seven times in a row. Eager to end her domination, Haruo duels Akira in Street Fighter 2 and resorts to underhanded tactics—which earns him a slap in the face from the shy girl. This encounter starts a strange and rocky relationship between the two rival gamers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]',	NULL,	'29/10/2010',	10,	NULL,	'finished',	'https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/212640l.jpg',	NULL),
